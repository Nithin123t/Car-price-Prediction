Car Price Prediction ðŸš—ðŸ’°

This project is a Machine Learning model that predicts the price of a car based on various features like mileage, year, fuel type, transmission, and other specifications.
The goal is to help estimate car resale values using regression techniques.

ðŸš€ Features

Loads and cleans car dataset.

Performs data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling).

Trains ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Evaluates model performance using RÂ² score and RMSE.

Provides predictions for unseen car data.
